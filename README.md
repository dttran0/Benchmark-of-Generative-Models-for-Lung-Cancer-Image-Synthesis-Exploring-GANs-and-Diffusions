# Benchmark-of-Generative-Models-for-Lung-Cancer-Image-Synthesis-Exploring-GANs-and-Diffusions

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) models for biomedical research has led to an increasing demand for realistic medical image generation. Among the various generative models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Diffusion models have demonstrated a great ability to generate synthetic images. We provide a state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark analysis in synthetic lung-cancer image generation between GAN, Baseline U-Net, and the recent Kolmogorov Anold Network (KAN) diffusion model. Specifically, we will be training upon two specific model architectures: Deep Convolution GAN (dcGAN) and UKAN. Performance of training and evaluation will be conducted through two prominent open-source datasets that further implied with random noises background: Iraq Cancer Teaching Hospital / National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH / NCCD) and the lung-PET-CT-Dx data set from the National Cancer Institute (lung-Dx). Based on our results, we conclude that UKAN, compared with other models on the same training dataset, delivers a more qualitative image generation and is suitable for the synthesis of diagnostic medical images.
